- Database persists between deployments
- Automatic backups available on paid plans

### Custom Domain (Optional)
- Free custom domain support
- Add your domain in the Settings tab
- Update DNS records as instructed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build fails**: Check logs for missing dependencies
2. **App won't start**: Verify start command and port binding
3. **Database errors**: Check file permissions and paths

### Viewing Logs
1. Go to your service dashboard
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. Monitor real-time deployment and runtime logs
